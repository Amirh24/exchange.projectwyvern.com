The Wyvern Exchange is a decentralized digital asset exchange running on the Ethereum blockchain.
</p>
<p>
This web application provides an interface to the Wyvern smart contracts, enabling users to buy and sell digital assets through the <a href="https://projectwyvern.com" target="_blank">Wyvern Protocol</a>.
<p>
</p>
<p>
The Wyvern Protocol is governed by the <a href="https://dao.projectwyvern.com" target="_blank">Wyvern DAO</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization. Anyone who holds WYV tokens is a shareholder in the Wyvern DAO and may directly vote on governance decisions or delegate their votes to a trusted party who will do so in their stead.
</p>
<p>
All application code is open-source. To request a fix or suggest an improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request using the <a href="https://github.com/ProjectWyvern/exchange.projectwyvern.com">Github repository</a>.
