<h2>What is the Wyvern Exchange?</h2><br />
The Wyvern Exchange is a decentralized digital asset exchange running on the Ethereum blockchain. Using the Wyvern Exchange, you can buy or sell anything you can represent on Ethereum, from virtual kittens to smart contracts.
</p><br />
<p>
<h2>Why use the Wyvern Exchange?</h2>
</p>
<p>
<h3>No trust required.</h3><br />
The Wyvern Exchange runs on the Wyvern protocol, a completely open-source platform for exchanging any digital asset that can be represented on the Ethereum blockchain.<br />
Neither we nor anyone you trade with can steal your funds or prevent you from transferring your items, and if we were to vanish in a quantum anomaly, you could simply run the Exchange yourself.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Buy or sell whatever you want.</h3><br />
The Wyvern protocol is representation-agnostic. If you can send it with an Ethereum transaction, you can buy or sell it on the Exchange.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Buy or sell the way you want.</h3><br />
Choose your method of sale - the Wyvern Exchange supports fixed-price sales, English auctions, and Dutch auctions alike.<br />
The Exchange is a two-sided marketplace. Both buy-side and sell-side orders are supported: you can sell your digital cat or place an order to buy any digital cat with blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
<h3>It's dirt cheap!</h3><br />
Right now, during beta, the Wyvern Exchange charges no fees at all.<br />
Later on, a fraction of a percent of each sale will be charged to pay for server infrastructure and support protocol development - but if you don't like that fee, you can run your own version of the Exchange without one!
</p>
<br />
<p>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2><br />
Navigate using the left sidebar to browse existing orders (items for sale) or place an order of your own. Alternatively, enter a search query in the top bar - try "cryptokitty".
